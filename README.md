# Introduction
In this project, I analyzed flu jab data from 2022 to evaluate vaccination trends, compliance rates, and demographic patterns. Using SQL to extract and prepare the data and Tableau to create visualizations, I developed a comprehensive dashboard. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as flu jabs by age and race, vaccination percentages by county, total compliance rates, and a running sum of jabs over time. This analysis aimed to provide actionable insights to support public health efforts in improving vaccination outreach and accessibility.

# Scenario
As a Junior Data Analyst, I took on a project to support a hospital's Emergency Room (ER) department. My goal was to analyze patient demographics and performance metrics to identify areas where the hospital could improve efficiency and patient satisfaction.

# Objectives
I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to provide clear insight into:
- Patient demographics by race and age group.
- Average wait time segmented by hour of the day.
- Average satisfaction score by demographic and overall.
- Department referral trends to understand patient flow after ER visits.

# Process
## Dashboard creating
Using Tableau, I built a dashboard that featured:
- A bar chart showing patient distribution by race and age group.
- A heatmap highlighting average wait times by hour of the day.
- A line graph tracking average satisfaction scores over months.
- A line graph showing average wait time by demographics.
- A bar chart displaying the number of departmental referral.

# Key insights
- Elderly patients tended to experience longer wait times, particularly during peak hours.
- Satisfaction scores dropped significantly for patients with extended wait times, highlighting areas for operational improvement.

# Outcome
The Tableau dashboard I created enabled the hospital administration to:
- Reallocate resources to reduce average wait time during peak hours.
- Streamline processes to improve patient satisfaction, especially for specific demographics.
- Collaborate with other departments to better prepare for incoming referrals from the ER.

# Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to analyse complex dataset, uncover actionable insights, and create interactive Tableau dashboard to communicate findings effectively.
