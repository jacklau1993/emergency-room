# Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed Emergency Room (ER) data to uncover trends and insights related to patient demographics, wait times, satisfaction scores, and departmental referrals. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as patient distribution by race and age group, average wait times, satisfaction trends, and referral patterns. This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw healthcare data into actionable insights, supporting data-driven decision-making to enhance patient care and operational efficiency.

# Data Collection and Preparation
The analysis was conducted using the Hospital ER.csv dataset, which includes information on patient visits to the ER. Key steps in data preparation included:

- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and corrected any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Data Transformation: Created new variables as needed to facilitate analysis, such as categorizing age groups.

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
Utilizing Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard comprising several key components:

1. Patient Demographics:
   - Race Distribution: Visualized the proportion of patients by race to identify demographic trends.
   - Age Group Distribution: Analyzed patient distribution across different age groups to understand the age demographics of ER visitors.

2. Wait Time Analysis:
   - Average Wait Time by Hour: Examined how wait times vary throughout the day to identify peak hours and potential staffing needs.

3. Satisfaction Analysis:
   - Average Satisfaction Score by Demographic: Investigated satisfaction scores across different demographic groups to identify areas for improvement.
   - Overall Satisfaction Trends: Tracked satisfaction scores over time to monitor changes and assess the impact of any interventions.

4. Referral Patterns:
   - Departmental Referrals: Analyzed patterns in patient referrals to other departments to understand patient flow and identify potential bottlenecks.

- Interactive Features:
  - Filters: Enabled users to drill down into specific demographics, time periods, or other variables of interest.
  - Hover Actions: Provided detailed information upon hovering over data points, enhancing the user experience and facilitating deeper insights.

# Key insights
- Demographic Trends: Identified key patient demographics, such as predominant age groups and racial distributions, informing targeted patient care strategies.
- Peak Hours: Determined times of day with the highest average wait times, suggesting opportunities for staffing adjustments to improve efficiency.
- Satisfaction Disparities: Uncovered variations in satisfaction scores among different demographic groups, highlighting areas for targeted improvements.
- Referral Bottlenecks: Detected patterns in departmental referrals that may indicate process inefficiencies or areas needing additional resources.

# Conclusion
This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, particularly in a healthcare context. The interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into ER operations and patient experiences, supporting data-driven strategies to enhance both efficiency and patient satisfaction.
